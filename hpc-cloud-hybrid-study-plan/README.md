# HPC ↔ Cloud Hybrid Integration Study Plan

## Overview
This study plan focuses on the integration, interoperability, and hybrid architectures that bridge High-Performance Computing (HPC) and Cloud environments. Rather than transitioning from one to the other, this program teaches how to leverage both paradigms together for maximum computational efficiency and flexibility.

## Target Audience
- **HPC Administrators** looking to extend capabilities with cloud resources
- **Cloud Architects** designing hybrid solutions for compute-intensive workloads
- **DevOps Engineers** managing multi-environment computational pipelines
- **Research Computing Professionals** optimizing resource allocation across platforms
- **Security Engineers** securing hybrid HPC-Cloud infrastructures

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this 12-week program, participants will be able to:

1. **Design Hybrid Architectures** - Create seamless integrations between on-premises HPC and cloud resources
2. **Implement Cloud Bursting** - Dynamically scale HPC workloads to cloud when local resources are exhausted
3. **Manage Data Orchestration** - Efficiently move and synchronize data between HPC and cloud storage systems
4. **Optimize Cost & Performance** - Balance workload placement for optimal cost-performance ratios
5. **Secure Hybrid Environments** - Implement comprehensive security across HPC-cloud boundaries
6. **Automate Workflows** - Build CI/CD pipelines that span both environments
7. **Monitor & Troubleshoot** - Maintain visibility and control across hybrid infrastructures

## Program Structure
- **Duration**: 12 weeks
- **Time Commitment**: 8-12 hours per week
- **Format**: Hands-on labs, real-world scenarios, and practical implementations
- **Prerequisites**: Basic familiarity with either HPC or cloud computing concepts
