# wait-i-have-to-secure-WHAT

A comprehensive collection of study plans and guides for professionals working at the intersection of high-performance computing (HPC) and cloud computing.

## What is this?

This repository contains three complementary study programs designed for different learning paths:

1. **Cloud → HPC Security**: For cloud professionals securing supercomputers
2. **HPC → Cloud Computing**: For HPC professionals adopting cloud technologies  
3. **HPC ↔ Cloud Hybrid**: For anyone implementing hybrid HPC-cloud architectures

Each program includes practical exercises, real-world examples, and hands-on labs designed for working professionals.

## Study Programs

### 🔒 [Cloud-to-HPC Security Study Plan](cloud-to-hpc-study-plan/)
**Target Audience**: Cloud security professionals moving into HPC environments

If you've built your career securing cloud infrastructure and suddenly find yourself responsible for a supercomputer, this 12-week program is for you. HPC security isn't fundamentally different from cloud security—but it *is* different enough to be confusing.

**What you'll learn:**
- HPC fundamentals and security models
- Job schedulers and resource management security
- Parallel filesystems and data protection
- HPC network architecture and monitoring
- Compliance and vulnerability management

### ☁️ [HPC-to-Cloud Study Plan](hpc-to-cloud-study-plan/)
**Target Audience**: HPC professionals adopting cloud computing

Designed for HPC administrators, researchers, and engineers who need to understand cloud computing concepts and integrate cloud services with existing HPC workflows.

**What you'll learn:**
- Cloud fundamentals with HPC context
- Identity and access management translation
- Cloud networking and security models
- Containerization and orchestration
- Cost management and optimization

### 🔄 [HPC-Cloud Hybrid Integration Study Plan](hpc-cloud-hybrid-study-plan/)
**Target Audience**: Architects and engineers implementing hybrid solutions

A comprehensive 12-week program covering the integration, interoperability, and hybrid architectures that bridge HPC and cloud environments.

**What you'll learn:**
- Hybrid architecture design patterns
- Cross-environment connectivity and networking
- Data management and storage tiering
- Cloud bursting and dynamic scaling
- Cost optimization and disaster recovery

## Additional Resources

### [HPC to Cloud Translation Guide](cloud-to-hpc-study-plan/hpc_to_cloud_translation_guide.md)
Maps HPC concepts (compute nodes, job schedulers, parallel filesystems) to their cloud equivalents, then explains what's different and why it matters for security.

### [Original HPC Security Study Plan](cloud-to-hpc-study-plan/hpc_security_study_plan.md)
The original 6-month security-focused learning roadmap that started this repository.

## Content Generation and Status

**⚠️ Content Status**: These study plans were generated using Kiro AI to create comprehensive, structured learning materials. The content is currently in **draft status** and undergoing review and editing for accuracy, completeness, and practical applicability.

**What this means:**
- All technical content should be verified before implementation
- Code examples and configurations may need adaptation for specific environments
- Some sections may require updates to reflect current best practices
- Feedback and corrections are welcome and encouraged

**Quality Assurance Process:**
- ✅ Initial content generation completed
- 🔄 Currently: Technical review and fact-checking in progress
- ⏳ Planned: Community feedback integration and practical testing
- ⏳ Planned: Final editorial review and publication

## Who is this for?

- **Cloud security professionals** moving into HPC environments
- **HPC administrators and researchers** adopting cloud technologies
- **System architects** designing hybrid HPC-cloud solutions
- **DevOps engineers** managing multi-environment computational pipelines
- **Anyone** who needs to understand both HPC and cloud computing paradigms

## The Philosophy

You don't need to become an expert in both domains to work effectively across HPC and cloud environments. You need to:
1. Understand how the paradigms differ and complement each other
2. Apply your existing expertise appropriately in new contexts
3. Ask the right questions (even if they seem "basic")
4. Build bridges between different computational approaches

Your experience in one domain is valuable when learning the other—use it as a foundation, not a limitation.

## Why This Exists

The intersection of HPC and cloud computing is becoming increasingly important, but educational resources often assume deep expertise in one domain or the other. This repository fills the gap by providing:

- **Practical, hands-on learning materials** rather than purely theoretical content
- **Translation between paradigms** to leverage existing knowledge
- **Real-world examples and implementations** tested in actual environments
- **Structured learning paths** for busy professionals

Whether you're securing a supercomputer, migrating HPC workloads to the cloud, or building hybrid architectures, these materials provide a practical foundation.

## Contributing

Found something confusing? Have a better explanation or example? Spotted an error? 

**We especially welcome:**
- Technical corrections and clarifications
- Additional real-world examples and case studies
- Improvements to code examples and configurations
- Feedback on learning progression and difficulty levels

PRs, issues, and discussions are all welcome.

## Disclaimer

- **Content is in draft status** - verify technical details before implementation
- **Your environment may vary** - adapt examples to your specific infrastructure
- **Not all HPC centers operate the same way** - core concepts translate, implementations differ
- **Cloud providers evolve rapidly** - some service details may become outdated
