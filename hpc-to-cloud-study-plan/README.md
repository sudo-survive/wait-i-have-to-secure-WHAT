# HPC to Cloud Security Study Plan
## 6-Month Learning Path for HPC Professionals Transitioning to Cloud

---

## Overview

This comprehensive 6-month study plan is designed for HPC (High-Performance Computing) professionals who need to learn cloud computing and cloud security. If you've spent your career managing supercomputers, parallel filesystems, and job schedulers, this guide will help you translate that expertise to cloud environments.

## Who Is This For?

- HPC system administrators moving to cloud roles
- HPC security professionals expanding to cloud security
- Research computing staff adopting hybrid cloud strategies
- Anyone who knows Slurm/PBS but not AWS/Azure/GCP

## The Philosophy

You don't need to forget everything you know about HPC. You need to:
1. Understand how cloud differs from HPC computing
2. Translate your HPC expertise to cloud equivalents
3. Learn cloud-native services and security models
4. Apply your systems thinking to cloud architectures

Your HPC experience is valuable - this plan helps you leverage it effectively in cloud environments.

## Learning Approach

### HPC-to-Cloud Translation Focus
Every concept is explained in terms of HPC equivalents:
- "This is like Slurm, but..."
- "Think of S3 as tape storage, except..."
- "VPCs are similar to VLANs, but..."

### Hands-On First
- Get cloud accounts (free tiers available)
- Practice with real cloud services
- Build actual cloud architectures
- Learn by doing, supplement with reading

### Security-Centric
- Every topic includes security implications
- Focus on cloud security best practices
- Understand shared responsibility model
- Apply defense-in-depth principles

### ADHD-Friendly Design
- Short, focused sessions (2-3 hours)
- Clear daily objectives
- Hands-on activities mixed with reading
- Practical deliverables each week

## Prerequisites

**What You Should Know:**
- Linux/Unix system administration
- Basic networking concepts
- Security fundamentals
- HPC concepts (job schedulers, parallel filesystems, etc.)

**What You Don't Need:**
- Prior cloud experience
- Programming expertise (helpful but not required)
- Specific certifications
- Enterprise IT background

## Getting Started

### Week 1 Preparation
1. **Create cloud accounts**: AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud free tiers
2. **Install CLI tools**: AWS CLI, Azure CLI, or gcloud
3. **Set up development environment**: Terminal, text editor, Git
4. **Join communities**: Cloud security forums, Slack channels, Reddit

### Study Schedule
- **Weekday sessions**: 1-2 hours per day
- **Weekend deep dives**: 3-4 hours for hands-on projects
- **Weekly deliverables**: Document your learning and progress
- **Monthly reviews**: Assess progress and adjust as needed
